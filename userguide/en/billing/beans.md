# What is 'Beans' #

Beans are virtual currency in docklet. And docklet will use <img src='../images/bean.png'> to represent the beans.
You can check your beans beside your portrait on the dashboard page, shown as follows:

Docklet will use your beans to pay for the resources your have used automatically.
If your beans are equal to or less than 0, all your vclusters(workspaces) will be stopped
 and you can not create, start and scale out any vcluster.
